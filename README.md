## Hypothesis
  <p> Springship hypothesizes that our Matrix Search Algo will run in O(n) time regardless of the size of an inputted matrix. </p>

## Background
  <p> Due to procrastination and time constraints, we did not teach ourselves again about command line redirection, as suggested by thinker Raymond Wu. Instead, we inputted data values produced by our MFDriver.java manually into a google spreadsheet that can be found here https://goo.gl/9B94JH. </p>
  <p> Due to our low budget machines, we had to perform the experiment on each matrix manually instead of all at once because of a lack of memory. </p>

## Experiment Methodology
  1. Create a class that makes a n by n matrix that aligns with the rules that values increase from left to right and from top to bottom.      This was completed in Matrix.java
  2. Our MFDriver.java starts timing prior to a loop that searches through each matrix for the bottom left value.
